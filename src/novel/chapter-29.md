# Chapter 29 – Lizardmen’s Invasion

There is a lake in the center of the Jura Forest, called Shisu.

A marsh surrounds the lake, and is controlled by the Lizardmen.

Countless caves surround their lands, forming a natural labyrinth thwarting any invasion.

Protected thus by the land itself, the Lizardmen peacefully ruled over the lake.

However, one day, troubling news reached them.

The orc army was advancing to the lake.

The Head, upon hearing these news, quickly issued orders.

「Prepare for battle! We’ll crush them!!!」

The Head was full of confidence.

Had they fought on the plains it might have been different, especially considering the Lizardmen’s were outnumbered,

But this battle would be on their terms.

If they set traps and proceed carefully, they were sure to win.

While sending some to prepare for battle, he also sent a reconnaissance team to investigate the orcs.

Knowing the size of the enemy is a must.

Along with becoming the leader, his intelligence increased.

The carnivorous Lizardmen would individually rank as a C+ monster.
